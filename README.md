# -Finance-Stock-Prices-and-Deep-Learning

Advances in deep learning techniques in recent years means more people are becoming interested in applying deep learning to finance. 

If you’re someone who is either:

curious about deep learning and want more practice or

wants to combine deep learning and finance

you’ve come to the right project. We will be reproducing a research publication that uses signal processing techniques and deep learning to train a model to predict stock prices in S&P 500. We also designed a project part from scratch, so you can practice classic time-series modeling techniques as well.
